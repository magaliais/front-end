<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this repository, you will find some of the pages I built to practice HTML, CSS, Sass and JavaScript. The pages are only views and often don't have any functionalities.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, I'm learning how to use Figma (which is where I designed the header of this readme). This document is yet to be finished.</p>
